Flash Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is sent to your wallet but does not remain there permanently, as it is dependent on the software used to flash the coin. While flash bitcoin is indistinguishable from real bitcoin, the key difference lies in its temporary nature. These coins are generated by specific flash bitcoin software, which allows users to send fake bitcoin into the blockchain network for a designated period of time, typically 90 days.

The Concept of Flash Bitcoin 

Flash Bitcoin operates on the premise of temporary digital currency. It is generated through specialized bitcoin flashing software, which allows users to send what appears to be real Bitcoin into the blockchain network.

During their lifespan, Flash Bitcoins function similarly to real Bitcoin, allowing for transactions and exchanges.
